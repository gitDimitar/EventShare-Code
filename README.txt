EventShareServer must be ran first in Netbeans, after it's ready for connection 
you need to go into EventShareAlpha(App files) go to "Utils.java" and change the IP of the socket connections
to the machine that is running the EventShareServer IP, or its router, if router port forwarding needs to be done
for port 1111.

24HrDelete produces a JAR file which is ran with Windows Task Scheduler(if nessecary).

PHP files are hosted online, they dont need to be touched.
